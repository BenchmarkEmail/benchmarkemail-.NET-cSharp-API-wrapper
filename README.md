API Version: 1.0
Tested under: .NET Framework v2.0

Requires:
           .NET Framework v2.0 


***** Setup ***** 
There are 2 DLLS included in this zipfile, Benchmarkemail Api library 'APIDLL.dll'
and CookComputing.XmlRpcV2.dll xml-rpc library.
You will need to include these in your project.

The DLL either goes into the "bin" folder under the root of your web app, or 
into the Global Assembly Cache on the box that the web app runs on.

To install it in the GAC, use gacutil.exe to install it, then go to 
"%systemroot%\Assembly" and make sure it is there.


***** Sample Code ***** 
See the included "Program.cs" file.
That has all the api examples that you will ever need.
Get started !!
